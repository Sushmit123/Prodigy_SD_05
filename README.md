🚀 Thrilled to showcase my latest project at Prodigy Infotech: a Web Scraping in Java! 

💻I recently completed a web scraping project using Java to extract product information from Amazon India. The project utilizes the Jsoup library for HTML parsing and data extraction. It connects to the Amazon website, retrieves the HTML document, and extracts product details such as name, price, and rating.

📂 Features:
Connects to Amazon India website
Dynamically creates a CSV file in the current working directory
Extracts product information using Jsoup
Writes data to a CSV file with product name, price, and rating

👨‍💻 Technologies Used:
Java
Jsoup library

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it as a reference for your own projects! 🔧🚀
